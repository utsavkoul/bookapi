Book API Manager is a simple full-stack application that allows users to manage a catalog of books and view book lists.

The project was built using Java Spring Boot (backend) for API development and React.js (frontend) for the user interface. Itâ€™s a basic version, meant to demonstrate full-stack integration, CRUD operations, and RESTful API design, rather than an advanced library management system.

**Tech Stack**

1. _Frontend_: React.js

2. _Backend_: Java Spring Boot (REST APIs)

3. _Database_: (e.g., MySQL/MongoDB) for storing book details

**Features**

1. _Book Catalog_: Add, view, update, and delete book entries.

2. _Book List App_: Display a list of available books with details.

3. _Simple UI_: Minimal React-based interface for basic interaction.

4. _Basic CRUD Operations_: Demonstrates how frontend communicates with a backend API.

**Project Purpose**

This application is not advanced but serves as a learning project to:

1. Practice building full-stack apps with Spring Boot and React.js.

2. Understand REST API development and frontend-backend integration.

3. Learn CRUD functionality in a real-world context (book catalog).

4. It provides a foundation for future expansion into features like search, authentication, reviews, or categorization.
